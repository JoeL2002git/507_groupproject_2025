# Q1. 5 Metrics: Jump Height (m) and Peak Velocity (m/s) from Hawkins dataset, distance_total and accel_load_accum from Kinexon dataset, leftAvgForce/rightAverageForce from Vald dataset
    a. Jump Height is commonly assessed in strength and conditioning fields, being used to measure the power of the lower-body and the vertical jump ability. Specifically, it measures the maximum vertical displacement of the center of mass (Nuzzo et al., 2011). 
    It is important for athletic performance, because many professional sports organizations (e.g. NFL, NBA, etc.) use it to assess athlete potential as well as monitor athlete improvements during training. It's an indicator of neuromuscular function and fatigue, correlating strongly with actions requiring rapid, high-force output like sprinting, changing of direction, and jumping.
